Sypnosis:

A teenage boy and teenage girl met online through a dating app.
At this day and age, the advancements of technology has resulted in more and more dating apps being developed. 
Will their relationship succeed or end up in despair?

Many people think that dating apps are rip offs. Johny, for one, strongly disagree with such unfounded accusations. 
In school, his poor looks and pathetic features makes him look like a clown in front of the popular girls.
Additionally, he is also a clumsy pig and tends to make a fool of himself in front of them.

Oh, how much does poor little Johny wish that his could become just slightly more attractive. 
But then one day, his wishes came true, a ground-breaking app was released--Dateme!
When Johny saw this new app, he was crazy over it!
Instantaenously, photoshopped-images of his body flashed across his childish mind.
He wondered, hoho, after my transformation online, my dating chance will surely sky-rocket!
With that in his mind, he installed this dating app and started trying to successully create an attractive profile picture, spending dusk till dawn in his room full of imagination.

After what seemed like eternity, Johny finally created what he though was the perfect profile picture.
Looking at his ripped body, his eyes sparkled while he grinned from ear to ear.
Without a doubt, he was certain that one of the girls would agree to date him.

Not long after he uploaded his profile, he already managed to secure a date. 
To his delight, the girl that liked his profile was one of the cool girls from school.
She probably could not recognise Johny as his profile name was actually 'John'.

For a few days, Johny chatted with the girl enthusiastically online, while slowing gathering courage to organise a physical date with her.
Soon, a date was finally organised.
Johny was exhilatrated but also nervous as he feared that the girl would be disgusted if she were to find out who 'John' actually is.

On the day of date, to Johny's utmost despair, the girl freaked out at the sight of him and immediately left the scene.
In Johny's mind, the love of his life had abandoned him. 
With broken heart, he decided gto write a song to mitigate his heartache.

This is what he wrote as the lyrics 
"I’ve only left for a short while and already started to worry about how you’re doing today.
My mind’s filled with you, when I think about you I can’t fall asleep.
Your cute expression when you pout, and also the fragrance on your body.
My happiness is you, when I think about you I always smile.
Chorus 1
When you’re not here, it’s so hard for me to bear.
When you’re not here, it’s so hard for me to bear, so troubled.
When I don’t have you to think about, I am so troubled.
When I don’t have you to think about, I am so troubled, so hard for me to bear.
Breaking through the clouds, I tried hard to run to you.
Just when love arrived, you were already in someone else’s arms.
Chorus 2
I just can’t open my mouth to let her know.
I will surely protect you and make you laugh.
You are so important to me, I regret not letting you know.
Quietly listening to you whine, watching you sleep till we grow old.
I just can’t open my mouth to let her know.
Those mere simple sentences, I can’t say them.
My whole heart hangs in the air, I can only watch from afar.
I can do all these things but that person is already not me.
Repeat Chorus 1
Repeat Chorus 2"

After singing this song as a class performance, the girl still did not care much about the unfortunate Johny.
Feeling helpless, Johny gave up chasing her, after all, she had her sights on someone else.
