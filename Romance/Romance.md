Sypnosis:

A teenage boy and teenage girl met online through a dating app.
At this day and age, the advancements of technology has resulted in more and more dating apps being developed. 
Will their relationship succeed or end up in despair?

Many people think that dating apps are rip offs. Johny, for one, strongly disagree with such unfounded accusations. 
In school, his poor looks and pathetic features make him look like a clown in front of the popular girls
Additionally, he is also a clumsy pig and tends to make a fool of himself in front of them.

Oh, how much does poor little Johny wish that his could become just slightly more attractive. 
But then one day, his wishes came true, a ground-breaking app was released--Milo!
When Johny saw this new app, he was crazy over it, immeadiately downloading it
Instantaenously, photoshopped-images of his body flashed across his childish mind.
He wondered, hoho, after my transformation online, my dating chance will surely sky-rocket.
