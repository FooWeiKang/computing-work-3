A teenage boy and teenage girl met online through a dating app.
At this day and age, the advancements of technology has resulted in more and more dating apps being developed. 
Will their relationship succeed or end up in despair?
Or are things gonna get complicated?
Or not?

Many people think that dating apps are rip offs. Johny, for one, strongly disagree with such unfounded accusations. 
In school, his poor looks and pathetic facial features makes him look like a clown in front of the popular girls.
Additionally, he is a clumsy pig and tends to make a fool of himself in front of them.

Oh, how much does poor little Johny wish that his could become just slightly more attractive. 
But then one day, his wishes came true, a ground-breaking app was released--Dateme!
When Johny saw this new app, he was crazy over it!
Instantaenously, photoshopped-images of his body flashed across his childish mind.
He wondered, hoho, after my transformation online, my dating chance will surely sky-rocket!
With that in his mind, he installed this dating app and started trying to successully create an attractive profile picture, spending dusk till dawn in his room full of imagination.

After what seemed like eternity, Johny finally created what he though was the perfect profile picture.
Looking at his ripped body, his eyes sparkled while he grinned from ear to ear.
Without a doubt, he was certain that one of the girls would agree to date him.

Not long after he uploaded his profile, he already managed to secure a date. 
To his delight, the girl that liked his profile was one of the cool girls from school.
She probably could not recognise Johny as his profile name was actually 'Tom'.

For a few days, Johny chatted with the girl enthusiastically online, while slowing gathering courage to organise a physical date with her.
Soon, a date was finally organised.
Johny was exhilatrated but also nervous as he feared that the girl would be disgusted if she were to find out who 'Tom' actually is.

On the day of date, to Johny's utmost despair, the girl freaked out at the sight of him and immediately left the scene.
In Johny's mind, the love of his life had abandoned him. 
With broken heart, he decided to write a song to mitigate his heartache.

This is what he wrote as the lyrics 
   "I’ve only left for a short while and already started to worry about how you’re doing today.
My mind’s filled with you, when I think about you I can’t fall asleep.
Your cute expression when you pout, and also the fragrance on your body.
My happiness is you, when I think about you I always smile.
//   Chorus 1
When you’re not here, it’s so hard for me to bear.
When you’re not here, it’s so hard for me to bear, so troubled.
When I don’t have you to think about, I am so troubled.
When I don’t have you to think about, I am so troubled, so hard for me to bear.
Breaking through the clouds, I tried hard to run to you.
Just when love arrived, you were already in someone else’s arms.
  // Chorus 2
I just can’t open my mouth to let her know.
I will surely protect you and make you laugh.
You are so important to me, I regret not letting you know.
Quietly listening to you whine, watching you sleep till we grow old.
I just can’t open my mouth to let her know.
Those mere simple sentences, I can’t say them.
My whole heart hangs in the air, I can only watch from afar.
I can do all these things but that person is already not me.
//Repeat Chorus 1
//Repeat Chorus 2"

After singing this song as a class performance, the girl still did not care much about the unfortunate Johny.
Feeling helpless, Johny gave up chasing her, after all, she had her sights on someone else.

However, when they had graduated, reality struck Johny as he realised that they would not be able to go to the same university.
Desperate to keep the girl in his sights, he wrote this song
   "I’ve rented a flat in the street where you live.
So that we might meet by chance.
In the third year of high school, why didn’t I study harder?
I couldn’t get in to the same university as you.
I found a job that was near your dorm.(So that Johny could meet her)
When I started to learn how to make omelette, I found that you don’t eat breakfast.
Oh, you passed me by again.
Could you tell me what you’re listening to on your earphones?
//   Chorus
Lying on the field at your school watching the stars.
The lights are still on in the classroom because you are still there.
Remember the love letter that I wrote to you?
What year is it now? Even now, I’m still writing it.
Someday some year you’ll realise.
There was someone at your side in silence.(Johny stalks her)
Perhaps I shouldn’t be in your world.
When you’ve get my love letter, it’ll mean I’m far away.(Johny eventually decides to leave)
 //  I was waiting in the square by the school for the bell to ring.
Would you like to walk with me after I wait for your class to end?(She does not)
Playing the piano, singing the song you love, the crush didn’t hurt at all.
What hurts is you didn’t even look at me. :(
Despite my touching songs, I can’t get into your heart.
Through the bustling crowds I’m looking for you, (attempting to) unconditionally protect you.
Oh, you passed me by again.
When I sing ‘Love Confession’, then do you finally turn around.(But still mostly ignore Johny's persistence)
  // Chorus"
   
Well, Johny had one last song to express his heartache and his resignation to his fate.
A small section of this song full of his complains goes like this
   "You don’t want to take risks when it comes to love.(Girl thinks that being with Johny is risky)
You don’t want to commit.(to Johny)
Is his(the other dude) embrace better than mine?.
Whatever makes you happy.
It’s okay if you don’t love me.
Before you leave,
I’ll give you a hug, although you don’t really want it. :(
But it’s not like I have any other choices.
My muscular chest,(Johny's imagination)
If you would like to come and lie on it,
and have the courage, then don’t leave.(But she did)"

In the end, Johny could only leave the one who he felt was love at first sight and romance did not prevail.

This is a very complicated story, but that is because Johny's life is messed up and full of meaningful information.
